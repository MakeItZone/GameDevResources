# Installation with Docker

Just follow the [instructions](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-with-docker/)!

Have a pre-configured `[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)` which is configured for gitea + mariadb + named containers which works very nicely on an Alpine Linux based VM. **Don't forget to change the user ID and credentials!**
